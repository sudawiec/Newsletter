## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties(variables)

### What I learned

- Usage of the flexbox order property

```css
.intro__top-text {
  order: -1;
}
```

- The text-transform property which let me change the case of text

```css
.btn {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

### Continued development

The next step I'm going to focus on:

- Making form elements interactive by using JavaScript
